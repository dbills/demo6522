;;; the sprite offsets for each city explosion can be derived
;;; from the assembled city constants, so there is one correct offset
;;; for each city

;;; this routine should select a city
;;; and generate a line for it

;;; we'll duplicate the existing line subsystem
;;; and say there are 10 missiles per wave ( or N )
;;; between waves we'll calculate a new wave and launch

;;; mirvs are preselected and in a table with the index of one
;;; of the existing lines
