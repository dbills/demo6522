TODO:
  12/25: working on general render routine
  the render selector embedded from the genline routine
  can be the same as the enum

  questions: should I store the lines
  in their actual 'long axis' locations in the line
  buffer or set to zero
  
  there is no advantage to putting them in place
  since it's unlikely I'll be able to use the Y
  register ( the plot routine uses it )

  I could use the x register?
  store the long_axis start, long_axis end
  values in the line_data struct
  then you can initialize x with the correct
  value and cpx against it

  need to alter genline.mac to write out
  long_axis_start
