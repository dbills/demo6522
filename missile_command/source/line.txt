Some notes about the Cartesian quadrant terminology used
admittedly it is a little abused but bear with me:

There are 3 domains for the Bresenham line drawing algorithm.  Each domain has 2 states, thus 2^3 = 8 different special cases for drawing lines.  The domains are

Let dx = x2 - x1
Let dy = y1 - y1
Let slope dy/dx

Let steep = slope > 1
Let forwardx = x2 > x1
Let forwardy = y2 > y1

Recall the cartesian coordinate system:

 2|1
--+--
 3|4

To make the metaphor we normalized line points such that x1,y1 are the origin.  Where x2, y2 falls, determines the quadrant.  Thus:

Quadrant1: forwardx = T, forwardy = T
Quadrant2: forwardx = F, forwardy = T
Quadrant3: forwardx = F, forwardy = F
Quadrant4: forwardx = T, forwardy = F


lines in a quadrant may be steep = T or steep = F
