TODO:

* change the screen column pointer table to tableL,tableH method.  This will clean up the code and
  allow us to actually store the column in thing like the mushroom code where we have mu_screen_col
  as a variable; but it's no really the screen column

  It will also be faster

* leave a crosshair mark when an ABM is fired

* implement 8.8 speed coding

* move the inside_x to the last check
  then you can check for left/right byte
  and do the conditional right there, 
  can I change the data structure so it doesn't care
  sbc #8
  bcs byte1
byte1:
  
  ldy byte_offset
  lda (ptr_0),y
  

IDEA: use the existing shape definition, it's already broken out into two separate arrays
