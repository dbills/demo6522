TODO:
* base explosion needs to destroy missiles
* Working on launching 2 icbms
Why are they always targetting the same city/

* change the screen column pointer table to tableL,tableH method.  This will clean up the code and
  allow us to actually store the column in things like the mushroom code where we have mu_screen_col
  as a variable; but it's not really the screen column

  It will also be faster

* leave a crosshair mark when an ABM is fired

* implement 8.8 speed coding

* delay before secondary explosion occurs

smart bombs

standard line plotting with avoidance by calling de_check in front of the path
when a decision to move is made, we need to recalc the path from the new course ( that's going
to be expensive )

* debugging stray pointer
Something put FFE0 in .sp_col1, during the flyer code
the pltbl is undamaged, but would be damaged at 1B
which is the .sp_col1,Y where Y = $3B ( 112)
what loaded sp_col1 with that? or was it, itself, damaged?
