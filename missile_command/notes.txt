TODO:

* change the screen column pointer table to tableL,tableH method.  This will clean up the code and
  allow us to actually store the column in thing like the mushroom code where we have mu_screen_col
  as a variable; but it's no really the screen column

  It will also be faster

* leave a crosshair mark when an ABM is fired

* implement 8.8 speed coding
