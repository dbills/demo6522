TODO:
  1/16
  working on a queue data structure
  new missiles start at the head
  meanwhile when a missile is terminated
  the dead pointer moves
  to update active missiles we only need to
  walk from dead to head and draw them

  missiles erase now - need to work on missile detonation
  animations
  A general framed sprite animation framework could be
  built, I believe we need 16x16

  sound, make missile away sound long enough for a long missile
  if we start the detonation sound on a missile end, then that
  solves the problem to what to do on short missiles
  next thing to work on is creating a quad_sprite_draw
  which, I thin is as simpe as widening the loop of bytes
  to copy from 8 to 16
