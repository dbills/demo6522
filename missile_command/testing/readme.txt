This directory contains c code for protyping certain assembly routines.
An experimental ( to me ) attempt at using racket scheme as a'repl' to test
the assembly routines using a 6502 emultator is also here, see
test-repl.rkt

the emulator is in the directory emulator
bresenham: a c prototype to help me write a line algorithm in assembly
tester.c: a c testing driver for the simple vic20 emulator
