.dat: files with purely assembler generated data in them
.mac: files with only macros in them
.asm: source code files
.equ: public variables for routines

pick a one or two charcter prefix for subroutines
and public variables
e.g.

prefixes:

i_xxxx is an initialization routine
pl_x : x for the plot routine
BIT_ : a bitmap

suffixes:

_SZ : size of a table
_w : word
_h : high byte of word variable

naming:

constants (equates) caps
no mixed case

problems:
using underscore is dumb unless you widen you margins, you only have 9 chars right now
use X register for counter ( save the Y for indirect Y)
